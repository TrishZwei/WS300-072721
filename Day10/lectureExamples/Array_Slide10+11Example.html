//If you do not see the above array properly, refresh the page.
//it should show the full value in the console and look like this:
//The current value of myArray is:  ["lettuce", "item1", "item2", "", "", "", "", "", "Milk", "milk"]
//if you open the console after the script is run it will show you the end result of myArray instead of the full thing.
console.log('The current value of myArray is: ', myArray); //will list the whole of what is currently in the array.

//removing item and storing its value:
var pop = myArray.pop();
console.log('the current value of myArray is: ',myArray, 'popped: '+pop); 

console.log(myArray[0]);
var shift = myArray.shift();
console.log('the current value of myArray is: ',myArray, 'shifted:'+shift);

myArray.splice(2,0,"butter");
console.log('The current value of myArray is: ',myArray, "spliced in butter. If you don't see the change here, refresh the page.");

myArray.splice(3,1); //removes 1 item from the array starting at the [3] index. Changed it from the slide so that we can see butter added.

console.log('The current value of myArray is: ', myArray, 'after splice(2,1)');
