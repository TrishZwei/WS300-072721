var name1 = "John";
var name2 = new String("John");

//variables can store the result of expressions.
var message1 = (name1 == name2); //true because they have the same value
var message2 = (name1 === name2);//false because they are not the same type

//they can also be added to themselves.
var message1 = 'name1 and name2 have the same value: '+ message1;
var message2 = 'name1 and name2 have the same value and type: '+ message2;

document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = message1;
document.getElementById('message2').innerHTML = message2;

/* 
Why is message1 true and message2 false?
*/

console.log(typeof name1);//returns string
console.log(typeof name2); //returns object

//because name1 is primative data, while it is a string type (note the lowercase s) it is not a String, though String is its prototype. 

//Because it is not an object it is not instantiated, therefore there is no instance of anything just primative data - which happens to be of a string type.

console.log('name1 is neither string or object since it is not instantiated', name1 instanceof String, name1 instanceof Object); //both false

//because name2 is a String Object it is an instance of both a String and an Object
console.log('name2 is both string AND object because it has been instantiated and is a string type.', name2 instanceof String, name2 instanceof Object) //both true
