	myVariable *= 1; //this always works, even when string is a decimal
	myVariable = Number.parseInt(myVariable) //converts to whole number only, but is great for other reasons.

	//it is now a number. If I use + I add

	myVariable = [myVariable]; 
		console.log('please note the array ', myVariable); //do you know why this has a value of 5?
	//it is now an array. If I use + I get an error which is why this is commented out.
	//console.log( myVariable + 1)

	myVariable = myVariable[0]-=0
	//it is once again a number
	console.log('please note the color of this item in the console ', myVariable + 1)
