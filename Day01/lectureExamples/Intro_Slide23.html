<div id="message">output goes here.</div>
<div id="message2">output goes here.</div>
<div id="message3">output goes here.</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
/*

'use strict';

var message = "Hello World"; //variable
var upMessage = message.toUpperCase(); //method applied to variable
var msgCharacters = message.length; //length property of message

document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = message;
document.getElementById('message2').innerHTML = upMessage;
document.getElementById('message3').innerHTML = msgCharacters;

/*
Please note that because we did not reassign the value of message with the = (ex: message = message.toUpperCase() ), the original value is still available in message.

This is just one of many methods available  to strings.
